Arabic Broken Plurals and Yangâ€™s Tolerance Principle 
(Team Members: Salam Khalifa, Kalina Kostyszyn, Yang Liu, Owen Rambow and Vasudha Varadarajan) I created an inventory of all plural forms (nouns and adjectives = nominals), indexed by lexeme (i.e., its lemma) found in the UPenn Arabic treebank. I used the CamelTools morphological inflection tool to generate plurals and check if the plural is a regular one by checking for the -At and -uw suffixes.  The results are ordered by frequency in the treebank.

Performance of Position Models on Mandarin syllables
The position models include two major types: Position based on string index and position based on syllable positions (onset, nucleus, coda). Mandarin phonotactic patterns are learned and examined by the Position Models. The four position models can process both the distant restrictions and the local ones with 90% - 100% accuracy. The performances of different position models are similar. This is possibly due to the short length of Mandarin syllables (length not bigger than 4). Thus, the index position labels (at most 4 indexes) are similar to syllable position labels (at most 4 indexes).
