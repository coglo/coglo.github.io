<p  style="text-align:justify">I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Linguistics Department at Stony Brook University.
</p>

<p  style="text-align:justify">
I am working on the data analysis of my thesis.
</p>

     
<p  style="text-align:justify">I am an Assistant Professor in the Linguistics Department at the  University of Utah.
I am a computational psycholinguist, also interested in mathematical approaches to linguistic theory (mostly dealing with issues in syntax and phonology).

<h2>Research (in brief)</h2>


<p  style="text-align:justify">
My research lies at the intersection between computational, theoretical, and experimental linguistics.
Essentially, I believe that language as a cognitive faculty can be characterized in fundamentally computational terms.
My work pivots around three central questions: What are the representational primitives underlying the language system? What are the essential computational processes of language processing? How do these components interact with core cognitive resources like memory? 
I approach these questions by drawing from different areas of theoretical computer science (in particular, formal languages and parsing theory), a  perspective that is multi-disciplinary at its core, and has allowed me to work on a variety of topics spanning phonology, morphology, semantics, and sentence processing.
